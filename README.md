# SQL_Zoo_Practice
- All practice from SQL Zoo's amazing practice libraries will be uploaded here. 
- Their prompts are comments and my responses will be directly underneath
## Instructions
### Practice and Portfolio Building workflow:
1. Start with an exercise link from the list below. (recommend starting w/ SQLZoo)
2. Make a new repository both on GitHub and your local computer. Name this repo “SQLZoo_SQL_Practice_Problems” or similarly named for the other exercise sites.
3. Make a new .sql file (or .py) in your local repo named after the 1st exercise directions or name it first_exercise.sql, if you are unsure of what to name the file.
4. Copy the exercise specifications from your browser and paste them as SQL comments in your new .sql file. Add, commit, and push the problem specification in the .sql file.
5. As you solve the SQL problems in the SQLZoo editor, copy your solution code and paste it into the .sql file that you made locally.
Add, commit, and push your work to GitHub.
6. Lather, rinse repeat.
